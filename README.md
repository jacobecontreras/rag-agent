# LEAPP Forensic Agent

A standalone Electron application for Mac that processes LEAPP forensic reports and provides a KML viewer and AI-powered agentic chat interface for semantic search and data analysis. Users provide a LEAPP report directory, which is chunked and embedded into a local ChromaDB database, which among other tools enables intelligent querying of the forensic data.
